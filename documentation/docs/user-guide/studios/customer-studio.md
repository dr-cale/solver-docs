### Prerequisites

###The flow of creating an Audience

Creating your audience in 5 steps:

* Choose Audience name 
* Select filters 
* Cross Audience
* Filter by products
* Audience overview 


The audience funnel follows the user through the process of creation, showing in  real-time the number of people in the Audience. Watch how this number changes as you add filters.

In **filters** step of audience creating the user can:
* Choose your audience age, gender and location 
* Select basic filter - demographic, geographic, lifestyle or behavioral
* Select additional filters (these filters are coming from the client, depending on segmentation)

In **cross audience** step you can:
* Filter by segment clusters - choosing another audience where the result is a cross-section of those two Audiences. When selecting one of the clusters, there is an additional setting (part of exact, or not part of exact audience)
* Machine Learning filters (ML) - using some of the ML models and setting the filter with them (for example CLV - customer lifetime value)
