### Prerequisites

###The flow of creating a Touchpoint

Touchpoint View is a combination of a place where the View will be shown with rules that are set in some of the Touchpoint. 
To create a new touchpoint view user should set: 
* Name of Touchpoint view
* In which Touchpoint the view will show
* Audience for view (the pool of customer to whom the view will be visible)
* Number of products in view (min and max value)

**Product Filtering** 

On the left side, similar to the funnel in Audience Studio, there is a preview of the most important information such as View location, View Audience, and View number of products. In this part, there is also an option to edit some of the settings without going back to the previous step.

In this step, you can set the rules for each product’s space in the certain View. 

If you don’t want to manually set filters for some product, at any time you can use our recommender model to get the best match for the certain Audience. 

When creating filters, user should define following parameters: 
* Type of filter (example: brand, price, category, supplier etc)
* Define chosen filter or a mix of filters
* Add or exclude the filter

In case that you want to set the general rules for all products, you can just select the product that you want to follow the same rule. 

Being creative by creating filters for Touchpoint view clients can easily make new conversions on site, or inside the application. 

With defined priorities and targeting the right audience, Touchpoint can bring valuable assets in achieving upsell.
